# My Personal Website
This is my personal website http://www.rspears.me, built using the Python framework Flask, JavaScript, and extensive use of the jQuery library.

## Parts
### Personal Home Page
My personal home page with general information about me and any projects (engineering or programming).

### Start Pages
Personal start/new tab page for my brother and I.

### Home Control Center
Page that allows me to control my Philips Hue lights and view my home using a camera attached to a Raspberry Pi. (Deprecated in favor of homeassistant.io)

### Structural Engineering Tools (*work in progress*)
Various tools for structural engineering tasks.

#### Max Forces in Span
This module returns the maximum forces on a simple span caused by a Cooper E-80 train. It also returns a plot, generated by [Matplotlib](http://www.matplotlib.org) and the [MPLD3](http://mpld3.github.io) library.
* Future features
  - The ability to select different vehicles or loads (AASHTO Trucks, pedestrians, custom vehicles).

#### Bridge Max Pier Reaction
This module return the maximum pier reaction for two different simple spans framing into one pier. The results plot showing the train location is also generated using [Matplotlib](http://www.matplotlib.org) and [MPLD3](http://mpld3.github.io).
* Future features
  - Again, the ability to use different vehicles and loads will be added at some point in the future.

#### Beam Calculator (*work in progress*)
This module uses the direct stiffness method to calculate the resultant deflections, rotations, and forces in a beam due to external loads. It allows the user to build a beam model and visualize the model using the [plotly.js](https://plot.ly/javascript) library. It sends this information back to the server where [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org) is used to process the information and calculate results. The beam calculator currently will return the deflections and rotations at each point, as well as the reaction forces.
* Future features
  - Deflected shape plot
  - Moment/shear plots
  - Stress calculation
  - Section builder
  - Code checks
